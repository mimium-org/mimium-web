{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}

**mimium** ( *MInimal-Musical-medIUM* ) is a programming language for sound and music.

mimium is made to be an infrastructure for distributing music in a form of a source code, not only a tool for musicians and programmers.

Its syntax and semantics are technically inspired from several modern programming languages for sound such as *[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr)* and *[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/)*.

You can write various expression from low-level signal processing to note-level processing with a simple syntax and high-performance.
Since all the code is executed with JIT compilation using LLVM which has an equivalent performance as the dsp code written in general purpose languages such as C++.
