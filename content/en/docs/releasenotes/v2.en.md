# Language Spec Changes in mimium v2

Based on reflections from previous development, mimium has been redesigned from scratch.

The implementation language for the compiler and runtime environment has been changed from C++ to Rust.

By redesigning the languageâ€™s fundamental semantics and defining a VM in Rust, the range of expressibility has greatly expanded. However, because the bytecode interpreter is executed in Rust rather than using JIT compilation with LLVM, the overall execution performance is slower than before. This will be improved by implementing a JIT compiler for the bytecode in the future. Even with the current implementation, performance is sufficient for tasks like duplicating about 100 sine wave oscillators.

With the new language specification design, it is now possible to compile code that uses higher-order functions to replicate stateful functions (those that indirectly call `self` or `delay`) for signal processing.

```rust
let pi = 3.14159265359
let sr = 44100.0
fn phasor(freq){
  (self + freq/sr)%1.0
}
fn osc(freq){
  sin(phasor(freq)*pi*2.0)
}
fn amosc(freq,rate){
  osc(freq + osc(rate)*4000.0)
}
fn replicate(n,gen:()->(float,float)->float){
        let g = gen()
    if (n>0.0){
        let c = replicate(n - 1.0,gen)
        |x,rate| g(x,rate) + c(x+100.0,rate+0.1)
    }else{
        |x,rate|  0.0
    }
}
let n = 40.0
let mycounter = replicate(n,| |amosc);
fn dsp(){
    let res = mycounter(4000.0,0.5) / n
    (res,res)
}
```

### Breaking Changes in Syntax

#### Introduction of the `let` Keyword

In mimium v2, several changes have been made to the surface-level language specification (syntax). For example, in previous versions of mimium, the same syntax was used for variable declaration and destructive assignment.

```rust
hoge = 10.0 // new variable declaration
hoge = 20.0 // destructive assignment
```

In v2, similar to Rust, you declare variables using the `let` keyword and perform assignments without `let`:

```rust
let hoge = 10.0
hoge = 20.0
```

Although this may seem to complicate the syntax, declaring variables with `let` clarifies the language's semantics. Within nested function definitions, `let` allows for local variable declarations and shadowing, making it easier to reuse short, simple variable names contextually.

#### Removal of the `return` Keyword

Up to mimium v0.4, the `return` keyword was required to specify return values in `fn` function definitions.

```rust
fn countup(active){
    return if (active) (self+1) else 0
}
```

From mimium v2 onward, the last expression in a block is the return value. This change, similar to Rust, removes the redundancy of the `return` keyword since early returns (e.g., via loops) are not needed in mimium.

```rust
fn countup(active){
    if (active) (self+1) else 0
}
```

#### Changes to Audio File Loading

Previously, audio files were loaded using `loadwav` and `loadwavsize`. This has been changed to a pattern using the higher-order function `gen_sampler_mono`.

```rust
// gen_sampler_mono returns a higher-order function that takes playback position in samples as an argument
let sampler = gen_sampler_mono("myfile.wav")
fn counter(){
    self+1.0
}
fn dsp(){
    counter() |> sampler
}
```

Audio decoding uses the [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia) crate in Rust. Therefore, all audio file formats supported by Symphonia, such as MP3 and FLAC, can be loaded.

### Features in v0.4.0 Not Yet Implemented in v2.0.0

- **Struct types and type aliases** are not implemented. This is a priority issue related to introducing polymorphism (generics). Proposals for record types are under consideration: [GitHub Issue #99](https://github.com/mimium-org/mimium-rs/issues/99).
- **Array definitions and access syntax** are not implemented due to issues related to internal array representation (array vs. list) and memory management.

### Non-Breaking Changes (New Features)

#### Addition of `letrec` Declarations

In mimium, recursive function calls are allowed only within functions declared with `fn`. Inline functions declared with `let myf = |x| { ... }` do not allow recursion. In v2, `fn` declarations cannot be nested, making it impossible to write recursive functions in nested functions.

To address this, `letrec` allows inline recursive function definitions:

```rust
letrec myf = |x| { if(x>0.0) myf(x-1.0)+1.0 else 0.0 }
```

Unlike `let`, which allows multiple bindings (e.g., `let (a,b) = tuple_value`), `letrec` binds only a single variable.

#### Placeholder `_` for Partial Application

Using an underscore `_` as an argument in a function application (or basic binary operator) creates a new function with that part as a new argument. This is implemented as syntactic sugar, making the following two syntaxes equivalent:

```rust
let f = foo(1.0, _, _)
```

```rust
let f = |a1,a2| foo(1.0,a1,a2)
```

Combining partial application with the pipe operator (`|>`) simplifies data flow expressions:

```rust
fn foo(x, y, z) {
    100.0 * x + 10.0 * y + z
}
let d2 = _ / _
let f = foo(1.0, _, 3.0)
fn dsp(){
    let x = 3.0 |>
        1.0 + _ |>
        d2(_, 2.0) |>
        f

    let y = 3.0
        |> 1.0 + _
        |> |arg| d2(arg, 2.0)
        |> f

    (x, y)
}
```

Currently, partial application creates and frees closures at runtime, causing slight performance overhead. This can be resolved with optimizations like function inlining and constant folding.

Future updates will add syntax for expanding arguments with tuples (parameter packs) using the pipe operator, alongside the introduction of record types.
